Inspired by the Justice League of America from rival DC Comics, the Avengers were conceived as Earth's Mightiest Heroes.\n> \n> The team roster has varied over the years, but there have been some consistent core members and themes:\n> \n> * **Founding Members:** The original Avengers lineup consisted of Ant-Man, Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, and the Wasp.  Captain America joined the team shortly after its formation, often considered a founding member.\n> * **Rotating Roster:** The Avengers are known for their revolving door policy, with numerous heroes joining and leaving the team throughout its history. This allows for a wide range of characters and storylines.\n> * **Protecting Earth:**  The Avengers' primary mission is to protect Earth from a wide variety of threats, both terrestrial and extraterrestrial.\n> * **Powerful Individuals:** The team typically consists of some of the most powerful beings in the Marvel Universe, working together to overcome threats too great for any one hero to handle.\n> \n> Some of the most well-known Avengers include:\n> \n> * **Iron Man:** A genius inventor in a powerful armored suit.\n> * **Captain America:** A super-soldier representing American ideals.\n> * **Thor:** The Norse God of Thunder.\n> * **Hulk:** A scientist who transforms into a rage-fueled monster.\n> * **Black Widow:** A highly skilled spy and martial artist.\n> * **Hawkeye:** A master archer and marksman.\n> * **Scarlet Witch:** A powerful sorceress with reality-altering abilities.\n> * **Vision:** A synthezoid with incredible powers.\n> * **Spider-Man:** A teenage superhero with spider-like abilities.\n> \n> \n> The Avengers have become one of the most popular and recognizable superhero teams in the world, thanks in part to their successful appearances in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films.\n"},"metadata":{},"execution_count":30}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["response1 = model.generate_content(\n","    \"Who were the Avengers?\",\n","    generation_config=genai.types.GenerationConfig(\n","        candidate_count=1,\n","        stop_sequences=[\"xip\"],\n","        max_output_tokens=50,\n","        temperature=1\n","    )\n",")"],"metadata":{"id":"YwmdBEg3KJcN","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1748995255176,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":1672,"user":{"displayName":"Atharva","userId":"10876295594296657967"}}},"execution_count":31,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["response1"],"metadata":{"id":"AI3jB6aGKKDp","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1748995255188,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":11,"user":{"displayName":"Atharva","userId":"10876295594296657967"}},"outputId":"5ba73e8d-cb3b-4589-80ba-b531d08288cd"},"execution_count":32,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["response:\n","GenerateContentResponse(\n","    done=True,\n","    iterator=None,\n","    result=protos.GenerateContentResponse({\n","      \"candidates\": [\n","        {\n","          \"content\": {\n","            \"parts\": [\n","              {\n","                \"text\": \"The Avengers are a fictional superhero team appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
